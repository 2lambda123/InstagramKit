{"name":"InstagramKit","tagline":"Instagram iOS SDK","body":"InstagramKit\r\n==================\r\n\r\nAn extensive Objective C wrapper for the Instagram API. \r\n\r\nThis framework is built atop AFNetworking’s blocks-based architecture and additionally parses the JSON response asynchronously so there’s absolutely no parsing on the main thread. \r\nIt’s neat, fast and works like a charm providing an easy interface to interacting with Instagram’s model objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Changelog:\r\nVersion 3.1.0 adds support for seamless pagination.\r\n\r\nRead about implementing Pagination effortlessly in the [Pagination Wiki](https://github.com/shyambhat/InstagramKit/wiki/Pagination).\r\n\r\n\r\n##Installation\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting started is easy. Just include the files from the directory 'InstagramKit' into your project and you'll be up and running. \r\n\r\n##### Cocoapods Podfile:\r\n```ruby\r\npod 'InstagramKit', '3.1.1'\r\n```\r\n#### Instagram Developer Registration\r\nHead over to http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/ to register your app with Instagram and insert the right credentials in InstagramKit.plist. \r\nIf you prefer the Info.plist for all your app settings, you can include these keys in directly in your info.plist file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n\r\nDownload and run the Demo Project to understand how the engine is intended to be used. \r\n\r\n<img src='https://raw2.github.com/shyambhat/InstagramKit/master/InstagramKitDemo/Instagramkit_demo.png' alt='Screenshot' width=310.5 height=625.5 />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributions?\r\n\r\nGlad you asked.
