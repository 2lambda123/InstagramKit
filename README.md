InstagramKit
==================
 
A clean blocks-based Objective C wrapper for the Instagram API. 

Harnesses the power of AFNetworking under the hood.

Parses the JSON responses on a background thread without affecting the UI, making your App slick and responsive.


Getting started is easy. Just include the files from the directory 'InstagramKit' into your project, insert the right credentials in the Engine and you'll be up and running.
Download and run the Demo Project to understand how the engine is intended to be used. You'll need XCode 5 and the iOS 7 SDK, however, to run the Demo.
