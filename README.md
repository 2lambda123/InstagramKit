InstagramKit
==================
 
A neat little blocks-based Objective C wrapper for the Instagram API. 

It readily parses the JSON responses on a background thread and does the dirty work for you so you just have to deal with Instagram model objects.
Harnesses the power of AFNetworking under the hood.

##Installation

#### Add Files to your project.

Getting started is easy. Just include the files from the directory 'InstagramKit' into your project and you'll be up and running. 

#### Cocoapods Podfile
```ruby
pod "InstagramKit", "1.1.0"
```
#### Instagram Developer Registration
Head over to http://instagram.com/developer/clients/manage/ to register your app with Instagram and insert the right credentials in InstagramEngine.h. 

#### I'm too lazy for that shit
In that case, you do not have to move a muscle. Simply continue with the temporary access keys provided and let the magic unfold.


## Demo

Download and run the Demo Project to understand how the engine is intended to be used.
